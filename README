CSS::Prepare 0.9.1
==================
CSS::Prepare is a pre-processor and minifier for CSS. It will take one or more
style sheets and reformat them to take up less bandwidth. It can also 
optionally optimise the CSS by rewriting it to be even smaller.

It understands (almost) all of CSS2.1 and some aspects of CSS3.

Plugins can extend the syntax of CSS, allowing features such as variables,
server-side calculated values, compound elements and mixins.
